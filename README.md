[Federal DCAT AP 2](https://github.com/belgif/inspire-dcat/blob/main/DCATAPprofil.en.md) is the profile "Data Catalogue Application Profile" (DCAT AP) developed by the Belgian federal administrations involved in the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive.
It also contains a **mapping** between the INSPIRE and DCAT AP elements.

In case of any discrepancies between the language versions, the French version prevails.
